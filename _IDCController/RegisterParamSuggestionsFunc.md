    Similar to **UpdateParamSuggestions**, but instead of providing suggestions once it provides a function to the IDC that 
    when called returns the array of suggestions.

    This is useful when you want to provide dynamic suggestions that change depending on the conditions of your game.

    The passed function is only called when the user is being shown the suggestions of the parameter targeted by this method.

        return new string[] { lineSpacing };
