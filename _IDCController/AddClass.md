  Adding a class registers all of its commands and variables with the IDC.

  Adding a class in the **Awake** method of a GameObject that is loaded at scene start might fail. If your object is available from scene start then 
  you should add it in the **Start** method.
  {: .warning}

  The class will automatically be removed from the IDC when it's garbage collected (e.g. When its GameObject is destroyed)
  {: .info }
