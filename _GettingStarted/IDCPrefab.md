description: Adding the IDC to your scene

content_markdown: |-
  The IDC prefab, found in `Ingame Developer Console/Prefabs/IDCCanvas`, contains the IDC UI and settings. 
  
  By default, you can open the IDC using the '~' key. However, this can be changed in the IDC settings Scriptable Object which
  by default can be found in `Ingame Developer Console/Settings/DefaultIDCSettings`.

  You can not use the IDC unless you add the IDC prefab to your scene.
