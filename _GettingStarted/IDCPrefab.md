  To start simply add the 'IDCCanvas' prefab to your scene. You can find this prefab in the 'Assets/Ingame Developer Console/Prefabs' folder.
  
  When your game is running you can toggle the console window by using the Backquote/Backtick key (**`**).

  The IDC will not work if you don't add the IDC prefab to your scene.
