  The IDC prefab, found in 'Ingame Developer Console/Prefabs/IDCCanvas', contains the IDC UI and settings.
  You can toggle the IDC console window by using the BackQuote key (`). If you want to only show the input field,
  without the log area, then you can use LeftShift + BackQuote.

  You can not use the IDC unless you add the IDC prefab to your scene.
