description: How to add your own cmd to the IDC

content_markdown: |-
    The IDC allows you to add any **method** as a command you can run from the terminal in-game. Methods you use as cmds can be public or private, static or not.

    Just keep in mind that if your cmd is not static then it will be called once per class instance, while static cmds will only be called once.
    So if you have 10 enemies each with a `Kill` method, then running the `Kill` cmd will call it 10 times, once on each enemy.

    Your new cmds will be added to the IDC when your class is registered (for example on `Start()`). Registered classes can be MonoBehaviours or normal C# classes, and normal C# classes can also be static.

    There is no need to unregister classes as The IDC will automatically detect when a class is 
    no longer used in the game and will remove it when the Garbage Collector runs.

    The following cmd changes the player health and returns the new value, which is then printed to the IDC.

    While typing a command's name you will see suggestions and can choose one by highlighting it with the arrow keys then pressing '**TAB**' to autocomplete it.
    Once a command's name is fully typed you will see all the parameters of the command that you need to pass.

    Each parameter is entered by putting a dash '**-**' followed by a space and then the value you want. If the parameter is a string you can either put
    double quotes or not. If you want to put double quotes inside your string then escape it with '**\**'. For example **"My special \"string\" that has double quotes"**.

    If your parameter is a class or a struct then you need to use brackets '**()**'. If you want to pass parameters to the class/struct constructor then put them
    between the brackets, separated by commas.

    Returned values from your commands (if any) are printed to the console.

    Always remember to register your classes, otherwise your IDC cmds and variables will not be picked up.
    {: .warning }

    Cmd names **must** contain only letters, numbers, and underscore.
