description: How to track your variables with the IDC

content_markdown: |-
  The IDC allows you to both track your variables and to edit their values through the 'Vars Window'.
  To open the vars window run the `ShowVarsWindow` IDC cmd.

  The window shows you a list of game objects, and under each object the registered classes that are
  attached to that game object, and under each class a list of registered variables.
  
  ![vars-window](idc-vars-window.png)

  The vars window can be moved by dragging it, and resized from the
  bottom-right corner of the window.
  {: .info }

  Just like cmds, variable names **must** contain only letters, numbers, and underscore.
  {: .warning }

  You can also change the value of an IDC Var by using the `SetVarValue` cmd. This cmd takes the
  name of the variable and its new value, along with the game object and class to change the variable on.

  ![set-var-value-1](idc-set-var-value-1.png)
  ![set-var-value-1](idc-set-var-value-2.png)

  If you don't select a game object and a class then all instances of variable are changed.

  The class index is the number after the class name. In the above image, '(Enemy:0)' means the class called 'Enemy' and an index of zero.
  {: .info}

  If your class is used on multiple game objects, you must use the index on the game object you are choosing
  {: .warning}
