content_markdown: |-
  All of the possible IDC configuration, including fonts, colors and functional things like
  speed and toggle keys are controlled by an 'IDCSettings' scriptable object.

  The default settings asset is stored in the 'Ingame Developer Console/Settings' folder,
  which you can modify to your liking. Additionally, you can create more settings assets by
  clicking the 'Create New IDC Settings' button on the IDC prefab.

  Multiple setting assets allow you to easily have different configurations for different
  use cases or preferences (e.g. IDC on mobile devices). Settings can either be placed
  on the IDC prefab directly or changed ingame by using the 'SetIDCSettings' cmd.
